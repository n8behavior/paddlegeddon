# Paddlegeddon - Zaney Ideas & Brainstorming

> Ideas contributed by The Pattycake Mafia during Discord chat

## Weapon Transformations

The paddle evolution system could get wild:

- **Pong paddle with a broadsword** - Medieval mayhem mode (ɹǝɥdoʇ)
- **Pong paddle with a gatling gun** - Bullet hell Pong (ɹǝɥdoʇ)
- **Pong paddle with sharks who have laser beams on their heads** -
  Because why not? (ɹǝɥdoʇ)
- **Pong paddle with a baseball bat** - While Peanut Butter Jelly Time plays (brett)

## Theme Packs & DLCs

### 4/20 Weed Theme (brett)

- All green everything
- Smoke effects on ball trails
- "Everyday McCoy" mode

### Pop Culture Mashups

- **Dirty Harry Boss Fight** (JAFO)
  - "Make my day" voice lines
  - Millions of "feelin' lucky punk?" text nodes flying around (brett)
  - CLINT EASTWOOD CHARACTER MASHUP (W1z3rd)

## Market Strategy

Following the "so dumb it's genius" approach:

- **Goat Simulator** proved weird sells (brett)
- **QWOP** showed frustrating can be fun (brett)
- Target the "what the fuuuuuck is this - i need to play it (BUY)" demographic (brett)

## Community Goals

- Make JAFO's day if even 5s of people buy it (JAFO)
- Gary's Mod level of moddability potential (JAFO)
- Epic DLC possibilities (JAFO)

## Development Philosophy

Embrace the chaos. If it makes you laugh, it goes in.
