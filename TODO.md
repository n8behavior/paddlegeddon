# Paddlegeddon Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Pong Foundation

### 1.1 Setup Game Module

- [ ] Create `game` module alongside `demo` (keep demo as reference)
- [ ] Add game module to main.rs plugin system
- [ ] Create initial module structure matching demo's organization

### 1.2 Basic Pong Implementation

- [ ] Create core components:
  - [ ] `Ball` component with velocity
  - [ ] `Paddle` component with player assignment
  - [ ] `Goal` zones for scoring
- [ ] Create game systems:
  - [ ] Ball physics (movement, edge bouncing)
  - [ ] Paddle movement (keyboard input)
  - [ ] Collision detection (ball-paddle)
  - [ ] Scoring system
- [ ] Add visual assets:
  - [ ] Simple paddle sprites
  - [ ] Ball sprite
  - [ ] Court/arena background

### 1.3 Game State Management

- [ ] Create `GameState` enum (Playing, Paused, RoundEnd, GameOver)
- [ ] Implement score tracking resource
- [ ] Add round restart logic
- [ ] Integrate with existing pause system

## Phase 2: Power-Up System

### 2.1 Power-Up Framework

- [ ] Design `PowerUp` component system
- [ ] Create `PowerUpManager` resource
- [ ] Implement power-up activation/deactivation
- [ ] Add visual indicators for active power-ups
- [ ] Create power-up UI overlay

### 2.2 Basic Power-Ups (Paddle Mutations)

- [ ] Wider paddle power-up
- [ ] Taller paddle power-up
- [ ] Split paddle (control multiple)
- [ ] Speed boost for paddle

### 2.3 Ball Manipulation Power-Ups

- [ ] Multi-ball spawning
- [ ] Ball speed modulation
- [ ] Invisibility flickers
- [ ] Curved shot capabilities

## Phase 3: Arena Evolution

### 3.1 Dynamic Court System

- [ ] Implement expandable play area
- [ ] Dynamic camera zoom based on game intensity
- [ ] Background transformation system
- [ ] Environmental hazard framework

### 3.2 Court Control Power-Ups

- [ ] Obstacle placement system
- [ ] Gravity well implementation
- [ ] Portal/teleportation mechanics
- [ ] Decoy ball spawning

## Phase 4: Player Transformation

### 4.1 Evolution System

- [ ] Design creature transformation framework
- [ ] Create base creature types:
  - [ ] Wizard (spell-casting)
  - [ ] Monster (raw power)
  - [ ] Ghost (phasing abilities)
- [ ] Implement transformation animations
- [ ] Add unique abilities per form

### 4.2 Advanced Mechanics

- [ ] Curved paddle physics
- [ ] Ethereal paddle phasing
- [ ] Special finishing moves
- [ ] Ultimate abilities at high power levels

## Phase 5: Polish & Effects

### 5.1 Visual Enhancement

- [ ] Particle system for:
  - [ ] Ball trails
  - [ ] Power-up activations
  - [ ] Collision effects
  - [ ] Transformation sequences
- [ ] Screen shake for impacts
- [ ] Dynamic lighting effects
- [ ] UI animations and transitions

### 5.2 Audio Evolution

- [ ] Implement dynamic music system
- [ ] Create progression from 8-bit to orchestral
- [ ] Add sound effects for:
  - [ ] Ball hits
  - [ ] Power-up activations
  - [ ] Transformations
  - [ ] Environmental changes

## Phase 6: Game Modes & Features

### 6.1 Victory Conditions

- [ ] Implement multiple win conditions
- [ ] Add finishing move system
- [ ] Create chaos threshold mechanics
- [ ] Balance rubber-band mechanics

### 6.2 Additional Features

- [ ] Replay system for chaotic matches
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] Practice/sandbox mode
- [ ] Spectator mode foundation

## Phase 7: Optimization & Testing

### 7.1 Performance

- [ ] Optimize particle systems
- [ ] Handle multiple balls efficiently
- [ ] Profile and optimize collision detection
- [ ] Implement object pooling

### 7.2 Balance & Tuning

- [ ] Power-up balance testing
- [ ] Difficulty curve adjustment
- [ ] Input responsiveness tuning
- [ ] Multiplayer lag compensation (if networked)

## Technical Considerations

- Use Bevy 0.16.1 features (Required Components, Observers)
- Maintain modular plugin architecture
- Keep state management clean and predictable
- Ensure all systems respect pause state
- Follow existing code conventions from template
- Reference demo module patterns for implementation guidance

## Current Status

**Starting Point**: Fresh from `bevy new -t=2d` template with demo module intact
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1.1 - Create game module structure
